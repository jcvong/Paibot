# Paibot (Genshin Impact)

A small side project for Genshin Impact, primarily focused at push notifications for PC players utilizing Discord and MongoDB to accurately notify users when their resin (stamina currency) ingame is refilled.

Core functionalities are implemented; later functionalities might include a roll simulator (figuring out the pity system mechanic), ~~news scraper~~ (MiHoyo's official Discord channel has text channels you can follow), and a database (either by scraping available databases or rebuilding one within MongoDB)
